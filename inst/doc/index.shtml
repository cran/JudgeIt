<p>JudgeIt allows a user to construct a model of a two-party election
system over multiple election cycles, derive quantities of interest
about the system through statistical estimation and simulation, and
produce output summary statistics and graphical plots of those
quantities.  Some of the quantities of interest are based on partisan
symmetry as a standard of fairness in legislative redistricting, such
as <em>partisan bias</em> as the deviation from fairness and
<em>electoral responsiveness</em> which indexes how party control of
legislative seats responds to changes in a party's success at the
polls even in a fair system.  (A uniform consensus has existed in the
academic literature since at least <a
href="/files/abs/sv-abs.shtml">King and Browning (1987)</a> on
partisan symmetry as a standard for fairness, and even the U.S.
Supreme Court now appears to agree; see <a
href="/files/abs/jp-abs.shtml">Grofman and King (2007)</a>.)  JudgeIt
will also estimate and graph seats-votes curves, make specific vote
and seat predictions for individual districts, and calculate numerous
other relevant statistics.

<p> The program can evaluate electoral systems (1) When an election
already has taken place, (2) When an election has not been held yet
but a new redistricting plan (or plans) has been proposed or
implemented, and (3) When you wish to assess what an election would
have been like if held under certain specified counterfactual
conditions (such as if no minority districts had been drawn, or term
limitations had prevented incumbents from running for reelection).
The methods implemented in JudgeIt were developed in <a
href="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/writeit-abs.shtml">Gelman and
King (1994)</a> and <a href="/projects/red.shtml">these other academic
articles</a>.

<p>JudgeIt II is a new program that works within R, and follows in the
spirit with the same purpose as the original version of JudgeIt, by
Andrew Gelman and Gary King.  This first version worked within DOS or
Gauss and included its own programming language, which is no longer
necessary due to features now in R.  The original version is still
available <a href="/judgeit/judgeitI">here</a>.
