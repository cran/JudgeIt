\section{Introduction}

\JudgeIt II brings the analytical routines of the original version of
\JudgeIt to the R Project for Statistical Computing, while also greatly
simplifying its interface and control system.\footnote{The original
  version of JudgeIt, written by Gary King and Andrew Gelman in
  versions available for DOS and in the language Gauss, is still
  available at \url{http://gking.harvard.edu/judgeit/judgeitI}.}  The
methods implemented in this software were developed in
\citet{GelKin90,GelKin90b,GelKin94a,GelKin94b,KinGel91,GelKatKin04}.

\JudgeIt allows a user to construct a model of a two-party election
system over multiple election cycles, derive quantities of interest
about the system through statistical estimation and simulation, and
produce output summary statistics and graphical plots of those
quantities.  Some of the quantities of interest are based on partisan
symmetry as a standard of fairness in legislative redistricting, such
as \emph{partisan bias} as the deviation from fairness and
\emph{electoral responsiveness} which indexes how party control of
legislative seats responds to changes in a party's success at the
polls even in a fair system.  (A uniform consensus has existed in the
academic literature since at least \citet{KinBro87} on partisan
symmetry as a standard for fairness, and even the U.S.  Supreme Court
now appears to agree; see \citealt{GroKin07}.)  \JudgeIt also estimates
and graphs seats-votes curves, make specific vote and seat
predictions for individual districts, and calculate numerous other
relevant statistics.

The program can evaluate electoral systems in three general situations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When an election already has taken place,
\item When an election has not been held yet but a new redistricting
  plan (or plans) has been proposed or implemented, and
\item When you wish to assess what an election would have been like if
  held under certain specified counterfactual conditions (such as if
  no minority districts had been drawn, or term limitations had
  prevented incumbents from running for reelection).
\end{enumerate}

For bias, responsiveness, seats-votes curves, and virtually every
other estimate, \JudgeIt provides quantitative estimates of uncertainty
(i.e., standard errors or confidence intervals).  This are recognized
as essential by social scientists and even the Supreme Court (see
Castaneda v.  Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 1977, and Hazelwood School
District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 1977).

\section{Installation Instructions and Requirements}

As this version of \JudgeIt has been built as a package for the
mathematical software R, it is necessary to install this software
before beginning.

The latest version of R is available for free from
\url{http://www.r-project.org}. After installation, retrieve the
\JudgeIt package through the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
> install.packages("JudgeIt", repos = "http://gking.harvard.edu")
\end{verbatim}

To use the commands within, type
\begin{verbatim}
> library(JudgeIt)
\end{verbatim}.

\JudgeIt requires the R package \texttt{mvtnorm} to function properly,
and will load it automatically when needed.

\subsection{Case Syntax}

In all instances, the stylized \JudgeIt refers to the software; the mixed case \textbf{JudgeIt} refers explicitly to the library name; and the lower case \jud is used for the primary analysis function and any contained terms,
such as \texttt{judgeit.object}.

\section{Usage Overview}

\JudgeIt can conduct three types of analyses:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluation, wherein the information gathered from one year's
  elections is applied to itself. This is done to suggest the
  underlying structure of an electoral system.

\item Prediction, which takes a set of observed covariates and
  predicts the outcome of an election. This can be done with or
  without the previous election's results and covariates included explicitly.

\item Counterfactual analysis, which estimates the results if the
  election had been run under different circumstances (i.e. with
  different predictors.)
\end{enumerate}

The \JudgeIt interface requires only \textbf{one} command to perform
analyses, called \jud. The standard auxiliary functions
\texttt{summary}, \texttt{print} and \texttt{plot} have been adapted
to display the object that results.

Two steps are required to perform a \JudgeIt analysis: election data
must be loaded into a \JudgeIt object, and the routine for analysis
must be specified along with its required options.

\section{Formatting Data Sets}

\JudgeIt requires each election to be reported in an object of type
\texttt{data.frame}.  This is natural if your data is in a
comma-separated or tab-delimited file, since operations like
\begin{verbatim}
data <- read.csv("ohio.csv")
data2 <- read.table("cali98.txt")
\end{verbatim}
will automatically put these tables into the data frame format. It
is important to make sure that each variable is labeled before using
it in the function \jud, either by making the first line
of the data file contain variable names, or by assigning them afterwards.
For example:
\begin{verbatim}
data <- read.csv("ohio.csv",header=FALSE)
colnames(data) <- c("district","vote","inc")
\end{verbatim}

Since most \JudgeIt analyses will involve a series of consecutive
elections, \jud accepts such a series as an object of type
\texttt{list}. Suppose we have three elections, say Ohio's State
Legislature in 1992, 1994 and 1996, and that each election is stored
in a data frame as above. To integrate the separate data frames, use
the command \texttt{elections <- list(oh1992,oh1994,oh1996)} which
will create an object named ``elections".  Each year's election data
\emph{must} use the same variable names, so that \JudgeIt can recognize
the same quantity across different elections.

\section{Included Data Sets}

\JudgeIt comes with data set ICSPR 6311, coded as \texttt{house6311},
containing the results for the U.S. House of Representatives from
1896 through 1992. It is formatted as a list of 49 data frames, each
named for their election year, and containing six vectors:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{STATE}, a numerical ICPSR state code for the state
  containing the district;

\item \texttt{DIST}, a numerical indicator for the number of the
  district within the state;

\item \texttt{INC}, an incumbency indicator, $-1$ for Republican and 1
  for Democrat;

\item \texttt{VOTE}, the share of the vote received by the Democratic
  candidate;

\item \texttt{TURNOUT}, the number of votes for the two candidates
  combined, and

\item \texttt{DELSOUTH}, an indicator for whether the district is
  located in the South.
\end{itemize}

\section{Step 1: Create a \JudgeIt object}

Now that there is an object containing the elections we wish to
analyze, we can load this object into \JudgeIt.  To do this:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
judg.obj <-
judgeit(model.formula=vote ~ predictor1 + predictor2 + modfun(vote),
    data=elections, vote.formula=cbind(turnout,eligible)~seats, ...) }
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent where the ellipsis ``\texttt{...}'' represents other possible
commands used by the R command \texttt{model.frame}.

\subsubsection*{Model Formula}

The model formula, \texttt{model.formula}, specifies the system's outcome
variable --- the \emph{proportion} of the two-party vote received by
the candidate for a specified party --- and any desired predictors,
such as incumbency status.  The predictor names must be the same as
the variable names within the data list (referred to here as
\texttt{elections}.)

Functions can also be applied to the variables within the formula.
For example, if we wish to create an indicator for whether a win is
decisive (for example, the winner more than triples the opponent's
votes), we first create such a function,

\begin{quote}
\texttt{modfun <- function(arg) -1*(arg<0.25)+1*(arg>0.75)}
\end{quote}

and then use it in the formula.  For example, with data set \texttt{house6311}
this formula works: \texttt{model.formula=VOTE\~{}INC+modfun(VOTE)}.

\subsubsection*{Voter Formula}

We use the voter formula, \texttt{vote.formula}, to indicate the
\emph{number} of actual voters (also known as the turnout), the number of
eligible voters, and/or the number of seats each district elects to
the main assembly. If this is omitted, the number of seats is assumed
to be one per district and the turnout is assumed to be equal in all
districts.

For example,
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{vote.formula=cbind(turnout,eligible)\~{}seats} specifies all
  three quantities.

\item \texttt{vote.formula=cbind(turnout,eligible)\~{}1} specifies turnout
  and eligible voters, and one seat per district.

\item \texttt{vote.formula=turnout\~{}1} specifies turnout. The number of
  eligible voters is ignored, and seats are specified at one per
  district.

\item \texttt{vote.formula=\~{}1} is the default option.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Options}

\subsubsection{Selecting a data subset}

For example, the data set \texttt{house6311} contains an indicator
\texttt{DELSOUTH}, which is 1 if a district is located in the south
and 0 otherwise.  To perform analyses on non-southern districts only,
initialize a JudgeIt object (in this example, \texttt{jud.ob}) with the expression

\begin{quote}
\texttt{jud.ob <- judgeit(...,subset=DELSOUTH==0,...,data=house6311)}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Automatic Use of Previous Year's Results}

The results of a previous year's election is often among the best
predictors of a current contest, and they are included by default. To
remove this option, include the option \texttt{use.last.votes=F} in
your \jud statement.

\subsubsection{Redistricting}

At some point during a state's existence, the electoral map is redrawn
to adjust for changes in the demographics of the districts.
Specifying whether the districts in one election are identical to the
previous one are vital to an accurate representation of the system.

By default, \jud assumes that if two consecutive years have the same number of districts in the map, then no redistricting has taken place.

To set a redistricting occurrence manually, \jud accepts
as an option \texttt{same.districts}, which indicates whether the
previous election used the same districting plan. In many states in
the American system, the easiest way to do this is to have a variable
specifying the election years and note whether the year ends in 2
\texttt{(year \%\% 10 == 2)}.  For other situations, you will need to
add a specially coded variable to the data frame and set
\texttt{same.districts} to it.

\subsubsection{Uncontested Districts}

\JudgeIt includes several routines to deal with uncontested districts.
By default \JudgeIt assumes that a vote proportion below 0.05 or above 0.95
indicates an uncontested district and are imputed; these levels can be
changes using the options \texttt{uncontested.low} and
\texttt{uncontested.high}.

The option \texttt{uncontesteds.method} indicates which method is to be used
to deal with districts tagged as uncontested:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{"default"}, which replaces uncontested values with
  assumed vote totals specified by \textbf{uncontested.low.new} and
  \textbf{uncontested.high.new} (default values are 25\% and 75\%);

\item \texttt{"impute"}, which uses the behaviour of contested
  districts to estimate unknown vote shares,

\item \texttt{"remove"}, which simply eliminates uncontested districts
  from the analysis, or

\item \texttt{"nochange"} which leaves the vote variable as entered.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Simulation Parameters}

JudgeIt analyzes election systems by simulating a number of
hypothetical draws of the election of interest, and computing
quantities of interest from these simulations. The default number of simulated elections is 1000; to change this, include the option \texttt{simulations} in the \jud command.

\subsubsection{Applying District Weights: Some Count More than Others}

Districts may have different influence than others when determining
the parameters of a system. To reflect this, we can assign a
\texttt{weight} parameter to command \jud:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{weight=constant} (default) in which all districts have equal
weight;

\item \texttt{weight=turnout}, corresponding to the two-party votes cast in each
district;

\item \texttt{weight=eligible.voters}, corresponding to the total number of eligible voters
in each district, or

\item \texttt{weight=seats}, the number of seats in each district.
\end{itemize}

This will have two distinct impacts on the analysis. First, in the linear modelling, each district will have a variance equal to a constant ($\sigma^2$) times the specified weight. Second, the mean vote will be calculated with respect to this weight; a \texttt{constant} weight will yield the average district vote, while setting the weight according to \texttt{turnout} will yield the grand average or ``popular'' vote.

\section{Step 2: Conduct Analyses}

Once an election system has been loaded into a \JudgeIt object,
quantities of interest can be simulated. There are three types of
analyses than can be performed:

\subsection{Evaluation}

The default setting of \JudgeIt for analysis, evaluation mode
examines an election under the actual conditions that took place.
Under these conditions, the systematic error component in simulation
(the amount estimated by the parameter $\lambda$) is identical, and
total error estimates are therefore smaller.

By default, all substantive outputs from \jud use
evaluation mode. For example, using a previously created \JudgeIt
object \texttt{judgeit.object}, we can obtain a seats-votes curve
using the command

\begin{quote} \texttt{
plot(judgeit(routine="seats",judgeit.object=judgeit.object))}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Prediction}

Prediction takes the information gleaned from one election and uses
it to forecast the results of a new election. In this case, since the new election hasn't taken place, the systematic error component is inestimable, and the total error component is generated.

To enable predictive mode, add the option \texttt{predict=T} to a
\jud analysis command. To specify new covariates for
this election, add the option \texttt{new.covariates} to specify the
new conditions, or use \texttt{new.covariate.matrix} to draw a new electoral map entirely.

\subsection{Counterfactual Evaluation}

This option supposes what might have happened if an election were
rerun under different circumstances. The systematic error component
is once again held constant to reflect that this is the same
``voting apparatus'' as was used originally.

To enable a counterfactual analysis, specify new covariates by
adding the option \texttt{new.covariates} and changing the relevant values.

\subsection{Using new.covariates to recode data}

In order to recode the data for counterfactual analysis or
prediction, the option \texttt{new.predictors} must be added to a
\jud analysis command.

As an example, suppose we wish to find out what were happened if term
limits were imposed and no incumbent could run for re-election, and
that the incumbency indicator is labelled \texttt{INC}. The option

\begin{quote} \texttt{new.covariates=list("INC",0)} \end{quote}

would instruct each routine to use this counterfactual data.

Suppose it came to pass that, instead, a group of representatives were
forced to resign shortly before the election. If the new incumbency
indicators are stored in a variable \texttt{new.incs},

\begin{quote} \texttt{new.covariates=list("INC",new.incs)} \end{quote}

would make that substitution. Make sure, however, that the
substitution variable has the same number of districts as the model
for that year; to confirm this, run the command

\begin{quote} \texttt{summary(judgeit.object,year)}. \end{quote}

\subsection{distreport: Examine the estimation}

The output of this routine is a reckoning of each district, including
the observed and hypothetical vote shares, the standard deviation of
the hypothetical estimate, and the probability that a voter in this
district would be able to change the outcome of the entire election by
reversing their vote.

\subsection{seats: Given a vote share, determine the seat share}

This is the basic tool used to determine the conversion between seats
and votes in this electoral system.

\textbf{Example:}
\jud\texttt{(routine=``seats",judgeit.object=j.ob)} will produce
estimations and errors for the fraction of seats received using the
default options: in particular, in the final election in the system,
at various values between 0.45 and 0.55.

\textbf{Example:} \jud\texttt{(routine="seats", judgeit.object=j.ob,voterange=c(0.1,0.9))} will now produce estimates
over a much wider vote range. Note that the farther we get from the
actual outcome, the less reliable the model will become.

\subsubsection{Plotting a seats-votes curve}

If the output in a \JudgeIt object was produced by \texttt{seats}, the
\texttt{plot()} command will recognize this and produce a seats-votes
curve.

\subsection{prob: Given a vote share, determine the probability of an electoral win}

As above, but replace ``seats" with ``likelihood of a majority for
party 1".

\textbf{Example:} \texttt{judgeit(routine="prob",judgeit.object=j.ob)}
will produce estimations and errors for the fraction of seats received
using the default options: in particular, in the final election in the
system, at various values between 0.45 and 0.55.

\textbf{Example:} \texttt{judgeit(routine="prob",judgeit.object=j.ob,voterange=c(0.1,0.9))}
will now produce estimates over a much wider vote range. Note that the
farther we get from the actual outcome, the less reliable the model
will become.

\subsection{winprob: Given a vote share or deviation, determine the probability that the seat share is within a particular margin}

\textbf{Example:}
\texttt{judgeit(routine="winprob",judgeit.object=j.ob)} does the
default: For the vote as it is, what is the probability that the seat
share will be between the default range of 0.45 to 0.55?

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{quote} \texttt{judgeit(routine="winprob",judgeit.object=j.ob, \\
  voteorshift="shift",voteshares=-0.05)} \end{quote} determines what the
probability is that the seat share will be between the default range
of 0.45 to 0.55, given that the resulting vote share was 5 points
lower than actually experienced.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{quote}\texttt{judgeit(routine="winprob",judgeit.object=j.ob, \\
voterange=c(0,0.5),voteorshift="vote",voteshares=0.5)} \end{quote}
determines what the probability is that the seat share will be below
50 percent, given that the resulting vote share was 50 percent for
each party.

\subsection{svsum: Determine partisan bias and responsiveness}

The title says it all. The output is a 4-by-2 table containing the
estimates and errors for four quantities: Partisan bias at an even
vote, both instantaneous and averaged over a 10-point swing, and
responsiveness at the midpoint and the observed vote percentage.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{quote} \texttt{judgeit(routine="svsum",judgeit.object=j.ob,year=which(elecyears==1976))} \end{quote}
will output those properties for the election held in 1976. (This
assumes there is a variable called \texttt{elecyears} which encodes
the calendar years of each election.)

\subsection{winvote: Given a seat share, determine the total vote share required to attain it}

The reverse procedure of \texttt{seats}. \textbf{Example:}
\begin{quote} \texttt{judgeit(routine="winvote", judgeit.object=j.ob,winvote=0.7)} \end{quote}
outputs the expected vote percentage needed to get 70\% of the seats.

\subsection{voting.power: Determine the power that distinct groups have in changing an election result}

Suppose there exists a distinct number of groups spread across the districts of an electoral map (by race, language, or some other delineation.) The routine \texttt{voting.power} calculates the power of an electoral group by estimating the probability that a vote from this group has in changing the result of an election, by flipping the outcome of districts in which they live.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{quote} \texttt{judgeit(routine="voting.power", judgeit.object=j.ob,voting.groups=matrix1,all.groups=matrix2)} \end{quote}

\texttt{matrix1} represents the voters in each group within each district; \texttt{matrix2} represents the eligible voters respectively. Each must have the same number of rows as there are districts in the system.

\section{Further \JudgeIt output options}

\subsection{System summaries}

Using the command \texttt{summary()} on a \JudgeIt object will give one
of two results. Without a year given, the output will be the number of
years, as well as the values of model parameters $\lambda$ and
$\sigma$.

With a year given, a report of the vote outcomes, predictors, seats
and populations will be the output.

\section{Accessing Raw judgeit.object Data}

All data are stored in an object of class \jud. If desired,
the user can access each component within. Here is a list of
components and their attributes:

\begin{itemize}

\item \texttt{covars} is a list of data frames comprising the
  predictors for each election in the system. So
  \texttt{judgeit.object\$covars[[25]]} is a data frame with the
  covariates from the 25th election.

\item \texttt{voteshare} is a list of vectors comprising the vote
  shares for each election in the system. So
  \texttt{judgeit.object\$voteshare[[25]]} is a vector of the results
  of the 25th election.

\item \texttt{turnout,elgvotes,seats} are lists of vectors
  comprising the actual turnout, the number of eligible voters, and
  the seats per district in the system for each election.

\item \texttt{fullrow} is a list of vectors containing those rows
  whose primary elements (covariates, vote shares, eligible and actual
  voters and seats) contain complete data.

\item \texttt{uncL,uncLR,uncU,uncUR} are the uncontested election
  detection thresholds and imputations as listed above.

\item \texttt{svexpected.value.only} is the value of \texttt{expected.value.only}
as given above.

\item \texttt{simulations} is the number of simulations conducted by
  \texttt{JudgeIt} during each analysis.

\item \texttt{weight} is the option selected by the user to indicate
  what weights should be used in the linear model, as described above.

\item \texttt{distweights} is a list of the actual values of these
  weights.

\item \texttt{covarsnew} is a list of data frames of counterfactual or
  future predictors as manipulated by the option
  \texttt{new.covariates}. It must have the same data type in each column as \texttt{covars} though not necessarily the same number of rows.

\item \texttt{same.dists} is a vector indicating whether the previous
  election's district map is identical to the current one, as
  described above.

\item \texttt{output} contains the output of the last analytical
  routine, and is displayed with the command
  \texttt{print(JudgeIt.object)}.

\item \texttt{outputyear, outputclass} indicate the year and type of
  the last analysis conducted. These are used mainly in
  \texttt{plot(judgeit.object)}.

\item \texttt{beta,vc} are the estimates given by the linear model for
  the system for the coefficients of the covariates and their
  covariance matrix.

\item \texttt{sigma,lambda,sind,lind} are, respectively, the mean and
  year-by-year estimates of the standard error and systematic error
  fraction of the system.

\item \texttt{years} is a vector of the names of each election
  variable in the inputted data frame list. In the case of
  \texttt{house6311}, this is a vector of the election years between
  1896 and 1992.
